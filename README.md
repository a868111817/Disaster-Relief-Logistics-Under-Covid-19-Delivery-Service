## Background: Disaster Relief Logistics

Our project is inspired by the research paper titled "A multi-objective robust stochastic programming model for disaster relief logistics under uncertainty" by Ali Bozorgi-Amiri et al, published in the OR Spectrum journal in 2011. Their model is a multi-objective approach with the following objectives:

1. Minimize the total cost and its variance.
2. Maximize the satisfaction level of the least satisfied affected area.

To address the uncertainty inherent in disaster scale, their model utilizes discrete scenario analysis to incorporate stochastic factors.
